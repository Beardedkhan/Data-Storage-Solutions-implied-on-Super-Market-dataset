# Data-Storage-Solutions-implied-on-Super-Market-dataset
Implementing SSRS and SSIS techniques, chalking out the Schema, ETL and implementing the same techniques to create visualization reports and graph databases with comparative conclusion
	Worked out initially to the process of selection of the perfect dataset with the imperfection of some hidden business intel atrocities, me and my group mates had meetings in person on picking out the perfect dataset for the purpose, we went on with several choices from airplane tickets and amazon yearly product selling reports, but since it lacked many features regarding some measures and fact table wasn’t falling in place, since after many considerations and consulting the Module leader herself we settled down on the Supermarket_sales_csv.
	It contained many features that were interesting as it was from a mart it had many columns such as tax rate and ratings which were useful and not useful at the same time but for the construction of schema, based on the techniques we learned in the class as to which methodologies should be implied and which attributes should be included in the dimension and fact table. Worked on multiple schema designs and again consulted the module leader and opted out the best suited schema.
	Business questions we opted are based on the best selling product type amongst the list of nominal valued attributes, another most discussed business question that we stumbled upon in our personal group meetings was which were the most profitable branch which is based on the city names, Second we looked the to the most used payment type as we have data from 2019 and most of the world is going cashless and mode of payment varied from e-wallet and cash to card, so we sort of looked at the percentage of online payment making customers.
	I contributed mainly on the SSIS part and development of schema and pretty much overall as well as we were working as a team, but my task much was around to extract the data from CSV and load in the Database for which I used MS SQL Server management studio, and for our transformation process I used MS visual Studio.


Reflection on Learning:
	Learnt ETL process through out most clearly cleaning the data on some specific formats.
	Picking out most prominent intel from the data and how to visualize it using Tableau and had a vivid experience to filter out business problems and have a step around to create optimal solutions around it.
	Learning to work around with graph theory and having hands on fiddling with neo4J.
	SSRS report generation with input based/drill down approach, and SQL 
	Teamwork and team co-ordination through out the process in midst of some challenging conditions.
	Maintaining the progress record and playing the role of medium & tracking the overall critic parameter and consecutively working toward the conclusion of the assignment.
